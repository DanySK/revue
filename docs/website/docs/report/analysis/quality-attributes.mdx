# Quality Attributes

Quality attributes are non-functional requirements that define the system's main properties exploited for
guiding architectural decisions to ensure and meet the properties below.

## Overview

The system should be designed to meet the following quality attributes.
In particular:

- Runtime
    1. The system should be modular and reliable:
        - The system should work even though some component is down or not deployed.
        - The system should work even though some component responsible for the storage of the data is down or not
          deployed.
        - The system should work with authenticated users even though the component responsible for the authentication
          is down.
    2. The system should be as much as possible available (and also replicable).
    3. The system should support many users at the same time.
    4. The system should be scalable and should support many devices.
    5. The system should be secure guaranteeing the user's data privacy and system integrity.
    6. The system should be observable, providing real-time monitoring, dashboards and logs.
    7. The system should be energy-efficient. It should be possible to deploy in a straightforward way the system on commodity hardware
    (such as a RaspberryPI).

- Development Time
    1. The system should be usable with a user-friendly and minimal interface.
    2. The system should be testable, with automated unit and integration tests.
    3. The system should be maintainable, with the possibility to fix bugs and add new features without affecting the
       system's overall functionality.
    4. The system should be deployable, with the possibility to deploy a new version of the software with zero downtime,
       without affecting active users and without manual intervention.
    5. The system should be modifiable, with the possibility to add new features or modify existing ones without
       affecting
       all modules or the overall system functionality.

## Identified Quality Scenarios

### Scalability

**Stimulus**: An unexpected increase in the number of users accessing the system.\
**Stimulus Source**: Many users access the system simultaneously.\
**Environment**: During peak usage hours.\
**Artifact**: The main service parts, such as the frontend and monitoring services.\
**Response**: The system should scale horizontally by adding more instances of the frontend servient and monitoring
service to handle the increased load.\
**Response Measure**:
The system maintains response times under 5 seconds for 90% of the requests even under increased load.

### Availability

**Stimulus**: A critical failure occurs and a service becomes unavailable.\
**Stimulus Source**: A hardware failure or a network outage.\
**Environment**: The system in its normal operational state.\
**Artifact**: The service that becomes unavailable.\
**Response**: The system automatically detects the failure and redirects traffic to a redundant service.\
**Response Measure**: The system remains available with a downtime of less than 5 minutes.

### Data processing

**Stimulus**: Thousands of WoT devices send data to the system.\
**Stimulus Source**: Devices distributed across various locations.\
**Environment**: The system is in real-time data processing mode (normal production operational state).\
**Artifact**: The data ingestion and processing pipeline.\
**Response**: The system ingests and processes the data from all devices in real-time.\
**Response Measure**: The system processes 99% of the devices' data within 100 milliseconds of receipt.

### Reliability

**Stimulus**: A software fault occurs in one of the system’s services.\
**Stimulus Source**: An unexpected software bug causes a service to fail.\
**Environment**: The system is running in a production environment in its normal operational state.\
**Artifact**: The affected service(s).\
**Response**: The system automatically detects the failure and restarts the affected service,
while maintaining overall system stability.\
**Response Measure**: The affected service is restored immediately after the failure is detected,
and no data should be lost or corrupted as a result of the failure.

### Observability

**Stimulus**: Something goes wrong in the system.\
**Stimulus Source**: The monitoring system detects the anomaly.\
**Environment**: The system is in its normal operational state.\
**Artifact**: The system’s monitoring infrastructure.\
**Response**:
The system automatically logs detailed diagnostic information and provides real-time dashboards for investigation.\
**Response Measure**: The cause can be identified analyzing the logs and dashboards at any time.

### Security

**Stimulus**: An unauthorized user attempts to directly access restricted services.\
**Stimulus Source**: A malicious user.\
**Environment**: The system in its normal operational state.\
**Artifact**: The gateway service that controls access to services.\
**Response**: The system blocks the access attempt.\
**Response Measure**: The unauthorized access is blocked immediately.

### Testability

**Stimulus**: A new feature is added to the system.\
**Stimulus Source**: The development team or an external contribution.\
**Environment**: The system in an active development phase.\
**Artifact**: The newly added feature.\
**Response**: Automated tests are executed to verify the functionality of the new feature.\
**Response Measure**: Automated tests (integration and unit) that provide results within few minutes.

### Maintainability

**Stimulus**: An issue is reported in the GitHub issue tracker.\
**Stimulus Source**: A user submits an issue report.\
**Environment**: The system is in its normal operational state but with a reported bug.\
**Artifact**: The affected component.\
**Response**: The development team identifies the bug, applies a fix, tests the corrected component and deploys the fix.\
**Response Measure**: The bug is resolved and deployed to production following the gravity of the issue.

### Deployability

**Stimulus**: A new version of the software is ready for deployment.\
**Stimulus Source**: The development team has completed all necessary updates or features.\
**Environment**: The system is in its normal operational state and a new version is ready for deployment.\
**Artifact**: The entire system, including all components and services.\
**Response**: The new version is deployed with zero downtime and without affecting active users.\ No manual intervention
is required.\
**Response Measure**: The deployment is completed within minutes with no incidents or the deployment is rolled back (
failed).

### Modularity

**Stimulus**: A new feature to a module or an entire module needs to be added to the system.\
**Stimulus Source**: A product enhancement, a change in requirements, a bug fix or a new feature.\
**Environment**: The system is in its normal operational state, and the new part of the system is ready for deployment.\
**Artifact**: The specific module that will be modified and their dependencies.\
**Response**:
The development team implements the new feature without affecting other modules or the overall system functionality,
helped from integration tests.\
**Response Measure**: The feature is added with no changes required in other modules,
and the implementation is completed within the estimated time frame.

### User-Friendliness

**Stimulus**: A new user attempts to complete a specific task or a non-technical user interacting with the system.\
**Stimulus Source**: A not particularly expert user.\
**Environment**: The system is running in its normal operational state.\
**Artifact**: The frontend (user interface), specifically the portion related to the task.\
**Response**: The frontend is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and minimal complexity.\
**Response Measure**: The user completes the task successfully with a positive rates in a eventual survey.

### Energy Efficiency
