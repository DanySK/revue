# Introduction

Revue is a real-time video surveillance and environment monitoring system.
It is designed to be used in multiple scenarios such as home, office or warehouses following the user needs. 
Revue permits controlling the environment through sensors and cameras, providing real-time data and video streaming. 
It is also possible to configure security rules, to get notified when a sensor data exceeds a specified range, or when a camera recognizes an intrusion.

## Scenarios

The system can be used in various scenarios, designed for multiple types of users, and depending on the user needs.
The sections below exemplify two main possible scenarios in which the system can be used.
In the simplest scenario, the system is used by a private user  
who just wants
to monitor his home or a particular environment without necessarily recognizing objects in the video. 
In this case, the user can just rely on the camera, monitoring the home or a proprietary field. 
The user is free to monitor the live video of the camera whenever and wherever he/she wants,
using the browser on the smartphone. 
The user can also set up sensors to collect data from the environment.

A more complex scenario could involve both sensor and camera usages with the support of an intelligent feature to detect intrusion. 
For example, the director of food wholesale could monitor the temperature of the warehouse and the presence of unauthorized people during the night. 
In this case, the recognition part of the system is necessary to detect whenever an intrusion occurs.

Moreover, supply chain monitoring can be another usage, 
to ensure that the temperature of a warehouse is always in the expected range (cold-chain) 
and be alerted whenever the temperature exceeds a certain range to detect or prevent problems.
