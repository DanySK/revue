# Conclusions

Future developments of this system will certainly have
to enrich the user experience to exploit all the possible features offered by the system.
Certainly, 
a well-designed user section and the introduction of more advanced role management could open up the system to new scenarios. 
Real-time video consultation could be improved with the introduction of video recording functions as well as a recorded history,
which has been put aside for now due to time restrictions.

This project allowed us to deepen our knowledge of the microservices architecture
and to understand the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.

A structured CI/CD pipeline helped us to build a robust development environment, 
managing the different services and their dependencies in a simple way. 
Moreover, it helped us to experiment with new technologies such as Kafka and Kubernetes. 

## Future work

### Revue

Future improvements to the Revue system:

- **Security Improvement**: Implement a real security scheme to protect the devices and the system.
- **Exploit Revue modularity**: Implement subscription to different plans to exploit the full potential of the system.
- **User Roles**: Implement user roles to manage the system in a more structured way.
- **Real-time Video Recording**: Implement real-time video recording to allow the user to record the video streams.
- **Frontend**: Implement advanced filtering, sorting, and searching functionalities in the frontend to improve the user experience.

### Revue: Web of Things 

Possible improvements to the Revue system about the Web of Things (WoT) are:

- **Security**: Implement a real security scheme to protect the devices and the system.
- **Protocol Bindings**: Implement more protocol bindings to support different communication protocols.
- **Discovery**: Implement a discovery mechanism to automatically discover and interact with new devices.
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Implement dynamic metadata to allow the devices to update their metadata during their lifetime.
- **Interactions**: Implement more complex interactions between devices and the system.
- **Model**: Implement a model to manage the devices and their interactions in a more structured way.
- **ThingDirectory**: Implement a ThingDirectory to store and manage the TDs of the devices, possibly due to his location.
- **Capability**: Implement more capabilities to support more complex devices.
