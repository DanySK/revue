# Self-assessment / Validation

In order to ensure a high-quality product, we have implemented a series of tests that cover different aspects of the system. The tests have been divided into three main categories: code quality, architectural testing, and API testing.

## Code Quality

Two main tools have been used to ensure the quality of the code produced:
**Prettier** is a code formatter that supports many languages. It enforces a consistent style by parsing code and re-writing it according to the configuration rules. 
**ESLint** is a tool that statically analyses code to find suboptimal patterns and errors.

Both tools have been integrated into the Continuous Integration pipeline to keep the high-quality code production.

## Architectural Testing

To ensure that layersâ€™ dependencies are respected, Dependency Cruiser framework has been exploited.
Essentially, the configured rules check that:
- The Domain layer does not access to any other layer.
- The Application layer can access only the Domain layer.
- Presentation layer can access only Domain and Application layers.

5.3 API Testing
API testing has been performed using Vitest framework.
To be able to execute the tests, the database has been mocked using MongoDB Mem-
ory Server.
In Listing 6 is reported a simplified example of an API test.
